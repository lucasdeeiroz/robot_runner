*   **Remote Device Connection (via ngrok):**
    *   Establish an ADB connection to a device located anywhere in the world over the internet.
    *   **Host Mode:** Starts a secure tunnel using ngrok for a locally connected device and generates a public URL.
    *   **Client Mode:** Use the public URL generated by a host to connect your local ADB to the remote device, enabling testing and debugging from anywhere.

*   **Interactive UI Inspector:**
    *   Inspect the UI of any application in real-time to easily create selectors.
    *   View the UI element hierarchy in an easy-to-navigate tree.
    *   **Bidirectional Interaction:**
        *   Click an element in the tree to highlight it on the device screenshot.
        *   Click an element on the screenshot to automatically select it in the tree.
    *   Simulate a `tap` on the device by double-clicking a selected element.
    *   Generate and copy XPaths with a single click (by `resource-id`, `text`, `content-desc`, etc.).
    *   Search for elements in the current UI using XPath queries.
    *   Optional automatic refresh when the device's UI changes, keeping the inspector always in sync.

    *   Monitor real-time usage of **CPU**, **RAM**, **GPU** memory, and **FPS** for a specific application.
    *   View "Janky frames" and "Missed Vsyncs" data to identify rendering issues.
    *   Save performance logs to a text file for later analysis.

*   **Test Logs Dashboard:**
    *   View a summary of all historical test runs.
    *   Group results by **Device**, **Suite**, or **Status**.
    *   Filter results by time period (Today, Last 7 days, etc.).
    *   Open the full Robot Framework HTML report with a double-click.
    *   Uses a caching system for fast data loading.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have the following software installed and configured in your system's PATH:

1.  **Python**: Version 3.8 or later.
2.  **Node.js and npm**: Required to install Appium.
3.  **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**: Essential for all device communication.
4.  **Appium Server**: The `appium` command must be executable from your terminal. It's typically installed via npm:
    ```sh
    npm install -g appium
    ```
5.  **(Windows Only)** For the embedded screen mirroring functionality, the `pywin32` library is required.
6.  **(Optional)** For the remote device connection feature, the `pyngrok` library is required.

## How to Use

### For Users

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lucasdeeiroz/robot_runner.git
    cd robot_runner
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **(Windows Only)** If you want embedded screen mirroring, install `pywin32`:
    ```sh
    pip install pywin32
    ```

7.  **(Optional)** If you want the remote connection feature, install `pyngrok`:
    ```sh
    pip install pyngrok
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python robot_runner.py
    ```

6.  On first launch, go to the **Settings** tab, verify that the directory paths are correct, and click **Save Settings**.

7.  In the **Settings** tab, click **Start Appium**.

8.  Connect your Android device (via USB or Wireless ADB). It should appear in the list on the **Run Tests** tab.

9.  Select a device, a test/suite file, and click **Run Test**.

### For Developers

The development environment is the same as for users. The main source code is centralized in `robot_runner.py`. Interface translations are located in the `locales/` folder. To add a new language, simply create a new `.json` file following the structure of `en_US.json` and add it to the `LANGUAGES` dictionary in the `RobotRunnerApp` class.

## Building the Project

You can create a standalone executable using `PyInstaller`.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```sh
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Run the build command:**
    From the project root, run the following command. It ensures that the translation and configuration folders are included in the executable.
    ```sh
    # On Windows
    pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "locales;locales" --add-data "config;config" robot_runner.py

    # On macOS/Linux
    pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "locales:locales" --add-data "config:config" robot_runner.py
    ```
    *   `--noconsole`: Prevents a console window from opening when running the application.
    *   `--onefile`: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
    *   `--add-data`: Includes necessary additional folders and files.

The executable will be created in the `dist/` folder.
